# PromptNeutral Development Todo List

## Project Overview

**PromptNeutral** is a comprehensive AI carbon neutrality platform that helps businesses track, calculate, and automatically offset the carbon footprint of their AI operations in real-time. The platform provides EU Green Claims Directive compliant carbon tracking with verified credit retirement.

### Core Functionality
- **Real-time AI usage tracking** via OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI APIs and others
- **Carbon footprint calculation** using peer-reviewed LCA methodologies
- **Automatic carbon credit retirement** with from a variety to crecdit types
- credit types are nature based, engineered removals, and energy attribution certificates.
- **Compliance reporting** for EU Green Claims Directive and other regulations
- **Dashboard analytics** with usage optimization recommendations

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Recharts
- **Backend**: Supabase (Auth + Database + Real-time)
- **APIs**: OpenAI Usage API, Carbon credit marketplaces
- **Deployment**: Railway

### Key Value Propositions
1. **Instant Carbon Neutrality** - Automatic offset purchasing and retirement
2. **Regulatory Compliance** - EU directive compliant with audit trails
3. **Real-time Monitoring** - Live tracking of AI usage and emissions
4. **Scientific Accuracy** - Based on peer-reviewed research and real energy data
5. **Business Intelligence** - Usage optimization and cost reduction insights

### User Journey
1. **Signup/Login** ‚Üí Supabase authentication
2. **Onboarding** ‚Üí Connect AI services, set carbon goals, select offset projects (show demo content clearly labelled and inviting you to add your data to show real data)
3. **Dashboard** ‚Üí Monitor real-time usage, carbon impact, and compliance status
4. **Optimization** ‚Üí Receive recommendations to reduce footprint and costs
5. **Reporting** ‚Üí Export compliance reports and certificates

### Current Status
- ‚úÖ **MVP Complete**: Homepage, dashboard, carbon calculations, compliance features
- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: Supabase setup, database schema, GitHub repository
- üîÑ **Next Phase**: Real authentication, live data integration, onboarding flow

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies to Add
- `@supabase/supabase-js` - Supabase client library
- `@supabase/auth-ui-react` - Pre-built auth components
- `framer-motion` - For smooth animations (optional)

### Database Schema (Planned)
```sql
-- Users table (handled by Supabase Auth)
-- usage_data table for storing API usage
-- carbon_credits table for offset tracking
-- integrations table for AI service connections
-- notifications table for alerts
```

### Environment Variables Needed
```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```
